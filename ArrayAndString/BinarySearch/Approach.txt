1. Decide Range 
How to decide range?
Split arrays -> number of partition (if it is 0 then and if it is n).
Ship -> number of days (if 1 day to if n number of days).
Painters -> if painters are n and if painters are 1.
Allocate Books -> if 1 student and if n students
Koko->minimum 1 and max is max of the array 
Smallest Divisor-> Smallest divisor will be 1 and largest will be largest of the array
Balls in bag -> Smallest bag capacity will be 1 and largest can be largest number of balls in a bag


2. Now check for mid val and see if this is our ans then does it satisfy the limit given(days/partitons etc.)
if in <= limit try smaller value if asked
else try fit ans in range
