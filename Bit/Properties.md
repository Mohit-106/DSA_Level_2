# 1. XOR
> a ^ 0 = a   <- 
> a ^ 1 = ~ a <- Toggle all bits
>In XOR 1 is powerful and it will toggle the bit while 0 is powerless it does not change the bit

# 2. AND 
> If we and all array element the resulting value will we <= the min element of the array

# 3. 2's Compliment == toggle all bit of a number x
>  x = 10101
> 2's Compliment of x = 01010

# 4. Right most set bit mask
> rmsbm of x  = x & x'' (x& 2'compilent of x)
> x  = x&-x;
